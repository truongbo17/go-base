## ðŸ“˜ Introduction

So why I use choose Gin framework?

- Based on benchmarks: https://gin-gonic.com/docs/benchmarks/
- Gin doesn't build everything from scratch, but relies heavily on Go's standard net/http (also one reason why i don't
  use fiber, even though fiber has better stats).
- Big community, really the biggest. With twice the stars and contributors of the second place competitor.
- Suitable for building RESTFul API, microservices or realtime applications.
